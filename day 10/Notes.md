## ðŸ“˜ Python Docstrings

Docstrings help you **document what your function does and how to use it**.  
They act like built-in user manuals for your code.

- âœ… Useful when working in teams or revisiting your code later.
- âœ… Shows up automatically when someone uses `help(function_name)` or hovers over the function in an editor.

### ðŸ“Œ Your Note (Improved & Cleaned Up)

> **Docstrings**  
> - Help us add information about our function  
> - Explain **what the function does** and **how to use it**  
> - So when someone tries to use our function, they can easily understand its purpose
